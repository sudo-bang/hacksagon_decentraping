## 🚨 What is DecentraPing?

DecentraPing is a **decentralized uptime monitoring platform** that transforms traditional website and service monitoring into a trustless, verifiable system. Instead of relying on a single centralized provider, DecentraPing uses a global network of independent validators who cryptographically prove whether your website is up — and get rewarded on-chain.

## 💡 Why do we need this?

Current Web2 monitoring solutions (like UptimeRobot, Pingdom, Site24x7) have fundamental flaws:

* **Centralized trust** — You must blindly trust one provider's infrastructure and reports.
* **Single point of failure** — If they go down or get attacked, your monitoring is compromised.
* **Limited global coverage** — Regional checks are costly or limited.
* **Opaque verification** — No way to verify how or where checks are performed.

## ⚔️ Our solution

* **Decentralized validators worldwide** run uptime checks, not controlled by us or any single entity.
* Validators use **Solana wallets** to cryptographically sign results, proving authenticity.
* Users receive **verifiable uptime proofs** rather than black-box status updates.
* Validators are **financially incentivized** via on-chain payouts.

## 🌍 Architecture Overview

```
User → Adds website to monitor
↓
Backend assigns validators to perform checks
↓
Validators run checks from different regions
↓
Validators sign results with Solana keys
↓
Backend stores signed proofs in MongoDB
↓
User views transparent uptime history and proofs
```

## 🟢 Validator staking & reputation model

### Staking

* Validators **stake tokens** to participate, creating economic skin in the game.

### Reputation

* **Reputation increases** when validators consistently provide correct, timely checks.
* **Reputation decreases** for incorrect or missed checks.
* Low reputation results in **stake slashing**, penalizing dishonest actors.

### Promotion to hub

* High-reputation validators can be promoted to **hubs**, decentralizing coordination further.
* Hubs earn **higher payouts**, incentivizing validators to perform well and stay honest.

## 💰 Economic model

* **Subscription model** for users (monthly or usage-based fees).
* Fees fund validator rewards, and a percentage is kept by the platform.
* Validators earn based on checks completed and accuracy.
* **Slashing mechanism** enforces honesty and integrity in the network.

## 💻 Tech stack

**Frontend**

* Next.js (React), TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
* Framer Motion
* @solana/wallet-adapter

**Backend**

* Node.js, Express.js
* MongoDB (Mongoose)
* JWT (jsonwebtoken), bcryptjs

**Blockchain**

* Solana
* Rust
* Anchor framework
* tweetnacl, bs58

## 🌟 Advantages over Web2 competitors

* **Trustless verification** — don’t trust, verify.
* **No single point of failure** — fully distributed validators and decentralized hubs.
* **Crypto-based incentives** — validators are rewarded transparently.
* **Global coverage** — truly worldwide monitoring without hidden costs.
* **Transparent proofs** — uptime logs backed by cryptographic signatures.

## 🚀 Future potential

* SLA-backed guarantees using on-chain proofs.
* Expansion to API and RPC endpoint monitoring.
* Advanced regional coverage customization.
* On-chain insurance and compliance offerings.
* Validator marketplaces and custom SLAs.

## 🧠 Final note

> Stop trusting opaque uptime providers. Start verifying it globally, cryptographically, and transparently. Welcome to DecentraPing.
